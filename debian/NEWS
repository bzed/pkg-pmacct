pmacct (1.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * With the packaging of the new major upstream release the all init
    scripts were reworked and various bugs being fixed.

  * Most important change for pmacctd users: Specifying multiple interfaces
    does not work anymore without manually copying / editing the
    defaults file and init scripts. Although this feature was nice
    to have, supporting it in systemd is rather hard (but possible,
    patches welcome!) and implementing it properly in an init script is
    also error-prone.
    The init script and defaults file were renamed from pmacct to pmacctd
    as it was supposed to be done some years ago already.
