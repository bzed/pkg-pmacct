TOOLS DESCRIPTION.

All daemons can print statistics to stdout, keep in memory tables, store
persistently to open-source RDBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sqlite 3) to noSQL
databaes (BerkeleyDB, MongoDB) and to flat-files, and publish to message
exchanges via AMQP. 

pmacctd		libpcap-based accounting daemon: it captures packets from an
		interface it is bound to. Other than acting as a collector,
		this daemon can also export statistics via NetFlow, IPFIX and
		sFlow protocols. 
nfacctd		NetFlow accounting daemon: it listens for NetFlow packets
		v1/v5/v7/v8/v9 and IPFIX on one or more interfaces (IPv4 and
		IPv6). Other than acting as a collector, this daemon can also
		replicate to 3rd party collectors.
sfacctd         sFlow accounting daemon; it listens for sFlow packets v2, v4
		and v5 on one or more interfaces (both IPv4 and IPv6). Other
		than acting as a collector, this daemon can also replicate to
		3rd party collectors.
uacctd		Linux Netlink ULOG accounting daemon; it captures packets by
		leveraging a ULOG multicast group - and works only on Linux.
		Other than acting as a collector, this daemon can also export
		statistics via NetFlow, IPFIX and sFlow protocols.
pmacct  	commandline pmacct client; it allows to retrieve data from a
		memory table plugin; it can perform queries over data or do
		bulk data retrieval. Output is formatted, CSV or JSON format.
		suitable for data injection in 3rd party tools like RRDtool,
		Gnuplot or SNMP server among the others.
