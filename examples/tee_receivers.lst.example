! tee_receivers: Tee receivers map
!
! File syntax is key-based. Read full syntax rules in 'pretag.map.example' in
! this same directory.
!
! nfacctd, sfacctd: valid keys: id, ip, tag, balance-alg; mandatory keys: id,
! ip.
!
! list of currently supported keys follows:
!
! 'id'                  Unique pool ID, must be greater than zero.
! 'ip'                  Comma-separated list of receivers in <host>:<port>
!			format. Host can be a FQDN or an IPv4/IPv6 address.
! 'tag'			Comma-separated list of tags for filtering purposes;
!			tags are applied to datagrams via a pre_tag_map map
!			and matched with a tee_receivers map.
! 'balance-alg'		Enables balancing of datagrams to receivers within
!			the pool. Supported algorithms: 'rr' round-robin,
!			'hash-tag' hashing of tag (pre_tag_map) against the
!			number of receivers in pool, 'hash-agent' hashing of
!			the exporter/agent IP address against the number of
!			receivers in pool.
! 'src_port'		When in non-transparent replication mode, use the
!			specified UDP port to send data to receiver(s) 
!			
!
! A couple of straightforward examples follow.
!
!
! Just replicate to one or multiple collectors:
!
id=1	ip=192.168.1.1:2100
id=2	ip=192.168.2.1:2100,192.168.2.2:2100
!
!
! Replicate with selective filtering. Replicate datagrams tagged as 100 and
! 150 to pool #1; replicate datagrams tagged as 105 and within the tag range
! 110-120 to pool #2. Replicate all datagrams but those tagged as 150 to pool
! #3. 
!
id=1	ip=192.168.1.1:2100			tag=100,150
id=2	ip=192.168.2.1:2100,192.168.2.2:2100	tag=105,110-120
id=3	ip=192.168.3.1:2100			tag=-150
!
!
! Replicate with balancing. Round-robin enabled in pool#1
!
id=1	ip=192.168.1.1:2100,192.168.1.2:2100	balance-alg=rr
