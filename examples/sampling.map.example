! sampling_map: given at least a router IP, returns a sampling rate
!
! File syntax is key-based. Position of keys inside the same row (rule) is not
! relevant; Spaces are not allowed (ie. 'id = 1' is not valid). The first full
! match wins (like in firewall rules). Negative values mean negations (ie. match
! data NOT entering interface 2: 'in=-2'); 'id' and 'ip' keys don't support
! negative values.
!
! nfacctd: valid keys: id, ip, in, out
!
! sfacctd: valid keys: id, ip, in, out
!
! list of currently supported keys follows:
!
! 'id'			SET: sampling rate assigned to a matching packet, flow
!			or sample. The result is used to renormalize packet and
!			bytes count if [nf|sf]acctd_renormalize configuration
!			directive is set to true.
! 'ip'                  MATCH: in nfacctd this is compared against the source
!                       IP address of the device originating NetFlow packets;
!                       in sfacctd this is compared against the AgentId field
!                       of received sFlow samples. Expected argument are an IP
!                       address or prefix (ie. XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/NN)
! 'in'  		MATCH: Input interface 
! 'out' 		MATCH: Output interface 
!
!
! Examples:
!
id=1024		ip=192.168.1.1
id=2048		ip=192.168.2.1 	in=5
id=4096		ip=192.168.3.1 	out=3
