This software is currently under strong development, i'll 
try to reach a good and stable stage as soon as possible;
The project has been started for practical reasons, i'll work
on it mostly in my spare time. Any comment, suggestion, test,
ideas and any other kind of help, contribution or support is
warmly welcome. Listed below are only few ideas to be reached
as soon as possible.
Currently, this software has to be considered in an early
development stage, so take care when using it in a production
environment.
I'm currently not able to provide any kind of mailing list or
mission critical support mainly for lack of time and resource
constraints. If you have ideas, resources or proposals, contact
me (email is in AUTHORS textfile); i'll answer you as soon as
possible.
 
 + explore new traffic sources other than promiscuous mode. 
 + strong improvements to the plugins architecture; more advanced
   concepts are needed. It would permit some advanced feature such
   as hotswap of old plugins without restarting pmacctd and should
   facilitate development of custom plugins. 
 + throw away pipes in 'core' <-> 'plugins' communications. As of 
   0.6.2 socketpair() has been introduced to alleviate pipe trobules.
   However this is not the best solution. Better ways need to be
   explored.
 + man page.
 + strong improvements to automake/autoconf part, i wrote a really
   rough Makefile.am/configure.in pairs, trying to make things work,
   that's all. 

Cheers,
Paolo
