UPGRAGE guidelines.
pmacct is developed keeping an eye to backward compatibility: the upgrade to some
newer version should be as smooth as possible from an user standpoint. This is
because, for example, features like SQL table versioning have been introduced
over the time. 
 
However, sometimes the upgrade may require some easy operations aimed to support
the changes done or break old assumptions no longer valid. Such happenings have
been (and will be) very limited through the development process.
 
TO:	>= 0.8.3 
FROM:	<= 0.8.2 
TOPIC:	Pre-Tagging, Post-Tagging
DESC:	In all previous releases, the 'pre_tag_map' and 'post_tag' directives were
        causing the captured traffic to be automatically tagged while forwarded to
	each active plugin; this behaviour can result in reduced flexibility; the
	0.8.3 release makes the two forementioned directives just to evaluate the
	tag to be assigned to captured traffic; a new 'aggregate' directive keyword
	- tag - causes the traffic to be marked (basing on the previous evaluation).
	So, a configuration like the following:

  	...
	pre_tag_map: /usr/local/pmacct/pre_tag.map
	aggregate[dummy]: src_host,dst_host,src_port,dst_port
	...

	Have to be rewritten the following way in order for the plugin 'dummy' to
	receive the tags:

	...
	pre_tag_map: /usr/local/pmacct/pre_tag.map
	aggregate[dummy]: tag,src_host,dst_host,src_port,dst_port
	...
