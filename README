NAME:
  pmacct (Promiscuous mode IP Accounting package) v0.8.8
  pmacct is Copyright (C) 2003-2005 by Paolo Lucente


DESCRIPTION:
  pmacct is a small set of passive network monitoring tools to measure, account and
  aggregate IPv4 and IPv6 traffic; aggregation revolves around the key concept of
  primitives (VLAN id, source and destination MAC addresses, hosts, networks, ports,
  AS numbers, IP protocol and ToS/DSCP field are supported) which may be arbitrarily 
  combined to build custom aggregation methods; support for historical data breakdown,
  triggers and packet tagging, filtering, sampling. Aggregates can be stored into
  memory tables, SQL databases (MySQL or PostgreSQL) or simply pushed to stdout. Data
  is collected either using libpcap (and optionally promiscuous mode of the listening
  interface) or reading Netflow v1/v5/v7/v8/v9 packets coming from the network.

  IP accounting is the key for a range of operations like billing, pricing models
  application, live or historical traffic analysis; it is also a valuable way to go
  for putting thresholds and firing triggers while measuring the underlying network.
  Taking SNMP data from physical or virtual interfaces of network equipments
  sometimes is not too useful because of coarse granularity of counters.
  Finer granularities are reached if counters match useful logical entities
  (such as Autonomous Systems, departmental networks, specific traffic flows,
  etc.).

  Many network equipments already support redirection of network traffic to a
  replication port; non-blocking architectures help in not negatively affect the
  global performances and routing/forwarding operations when mirroring data. 
  Alternatively, some equipments support export protocols (like Cisco's Netflow)
  to monitor the network at a traffic flows level.
  Both approaches, traffic mirroring and export protocols, leave new chances to
  monitor the network online (but not inline), off critical paths. This translates
  in new opportunities arising for advanced data manipulation or post-processing
  activities.

  Please refer to the TODO file to read about some immediate future projects  
  about development of this tool.
