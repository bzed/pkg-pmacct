NAME:
  pmacct (Promiscuous mode IP Accounting package) v0.8.3
  pmacct is Copyright (C) 2003-2005 by Paolo Lucente


DESCRIPTION:
  pmacct is a small set of tools to account and aggregate IPv4 and IPv6 traffic;
  aggregation revolves around the key concept of primitives (VLAN id, source and
  destination MAC addresses, hosts, networks, AS numbers, ports, IP protocol and
  ToS/DSCP field are supported) which may be employed alone or arbitrarily combined
  with others to form complex aggregation methods; support for custom historical
  breakdown, packet tagging, filtering and sampling. Aggregates can be stored into
  memory tables, SQL databases (MySQL or PostgreSQL) or simply pushed to stdout.
  Data is collected either using libpcap (and optionally promiscuous mode of the
  listening interface) or reading Netflow v1/v5/v9 packets coming from the network.

  IP accounting is the key for a range of operations like billing, pricing
  models application, live or historical traffic analysis; it is also a valuable
  way to go for handling network thresholds or bandwidth management. Taking SNMP
  data from physical or virtual interfaces of network equipments sometimes
  is not too useful because of coarse granularity of counters.
  Finer granularities are reached if counters match useful logical entities
  (such as Autonomous Systems, departmental networks, specific traffic flows,
  etc.).

  Many network equipments already support redirection of network traffic to a
  replication port; here, non-blocking architectures help in not negatively
  affect global performances and usual routing or forwarding operations when
  mirroring data. Alternatively, some equipments support export protocols (like
  Cisco's Netflow) to describe traffic flows.
  Both approaches, traffic mirroring and export protocols, leave new chances
  to do IP accounting online (but not inline), off critical paths. New opportunities
  arise for advanced data manipulation or post-processing activities.

  Please refer to the TODO file to read about some immediate future projects  
  about development of this tool.
